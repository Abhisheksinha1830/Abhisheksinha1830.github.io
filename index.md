### Machine learning-based demand forecasting model for a leading Global CPG company
The client initially relied on a heuristic forecasting approach characterized by high uncertainty, inconsistency, and limited accuracy, as evident in their forecasts, resulting in inventory imbalances. To address this issue, I developed and implemented a robust machine learning-based demand forecasting model at a granular level, specifically at the distribution level. This implementation significantly improved accuracy, raising it from 37% to an impressive 76%
